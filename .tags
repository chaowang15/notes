2D projective geometry and transformation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\newpage$/;"	s
3D Points and planes	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Similar to $\\mathbb{P}^2$ described in Section \\ref{sec:2d}, $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is equal to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ augmented with a set of ideal points which are on the plane $\\bm{\\pi}_{\\infty} = (0, 0, 0, 1)^\\top$ (that is, an ideal point is like $(x_1, x_2, x_3, 0)^\\top$).$/;"	u

Definition	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Unit quaternions, also known as versors, provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing orientations and rotations of objects in three dimensions. Compared to Euler angles, they are simpler to compose and avoid the problem of \\textit{gimbal lock}. Compared to rotation matrices, they are more compact, more numerically stable, and may be more efficient. When used to represent rotation, unit quaternions are also called \\textbf{rotation quaternions}.$/;"	b
Definition and properties	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\subsection{Line and point}$/;"	b
Duality and dual conics	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Note that if $\\mathbf{C}$ is not full-rank, then the conic is \\textbf{degenerate}, such as two lines $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{l}_1\\mathbf{l}_2^\\top + \\mathbf{l}_2\\mathbf{l}_1^\\top$ or a repeated line  $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{l}\\mathbf{l}^\\top$.$/;"	b
Eigenvalue decomposition	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^A matrix is called \\textit{skew-symmetric} if $\\mathbf{A}^\\top = - \\mathbf{A}$. Clearly, all diagonal values are 0.$/;"	b
Features and properties	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Actually, a quaternion doesn't need to be unit, but only unit quaternion can be used as rotation quaternion, and it also has many convenient features and properties.$/;"	b

Gradient descent method	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^The iterative procedure in Eq. (\\ref{eq:nonlinear:newton}) using Hessian shown in Eq. (\\ref{eq:nonlinear:hessian}) is called \\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Newton's Method}}. If assuming that $\\mathbf{f(P)}$ is linear, then $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{PP}} = 0$ and the Hessian will be $g_{\\mathbf{PP}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{P}}^\\top \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{P}} = \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{J}$, and the problem in Eq. (\\ref{eq:nonlinear:newton}) will reduce to the same linear minimization problem shown in Eq. (\\ref{eq:nonlinear:gaussnewton}). This procedure in which $\\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{J}$ is used as an approximation for the Hessian in Eq. (\\ref{eq:nonlinear:hessian}) is known as the \\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Gauss-Newton Method}}.$/;"	u
Intersection	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\end{itemize}$/;"	b
Levenberg-Marquardt method	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^We may consider this as an approximation of Hessian by $\\lambda \\mathbf{I}$. Even thought gradient descent is not a good minimization strategy, it can be useful in conjunction with Gauss-Newton iteration as a way of getting out of tight corners. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is essentially a Gauss-Newton method that transitions smoothly to gradient descent when Gauss-Newton updates fail.$/;"	u
Line and point	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^This section summarizes from Section 2 in Ref. \\cite{hartley2003multiple}.$/;"	u

Orthogonal matrix and unitary matrix	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^A complex square matrix is \\textbf{Hermitian} if it is equal to its Hermitian transpose. That is, $\\mathbf{A = A^*}$. The Hermitian matrix is the complex version of a real symmetric matrix.$/;"	u
Plane at infinity	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^In Section \\ref{2d_proj_distortion}, we described 2D planar projective geometry and distortion removal which identifies three key components: line at infinity $\\mathbf{l}_{\\infty}$, circular points $\\mathbf{I, J}$ on $\\mathbf{l}_{\\infty}$, and circular points' dual conic $\\mathbf{C}_{\\infty}^*$. In 3D projective geometry, their corresponding geometric entities are: plane at infinity $\\bm{\\pi}_{\\infty}$, absolute conic $\\bm{\\Omega}_{\\infty}$ on $\\bm{\\pi}_{\\infty}$, and absolute conic's dual quadric $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\infty}^*$.$/;"	b
Positive-definite symmetric matrix	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^A symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has an important property called \\textbf{Eigenvalue decomposition} that $\\mathbf{A}$ can be decomposed into $\\mathbf{A = UDU^\\top}$, where $\\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix composed of its eigenvalues, and $\\mathbf{U}$ an orthogonal matrix with eigenvectors. This is described in Section \\ref{sec:eigen_decomp}.$/;"	b
Projective transformation between planes	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\textbf{Transformed line}. We have already proved in Theorem \\ref{theorem:projectivity} that the transformed line is $\\mathbf{l' = H^{-\\top}l}$.$/;"	b

Quaternion and spatial rotation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Or, it can be written more concisely using the skew-symmetric form as shown in Eq. (\\ref{eq:skew:rotangleaxis}). See Section \\ref{sec:skew} for more details about skew-symmetric matrix.$/;"	u
Relationship between skew-symmetric matrix and rotation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\end{itemize}$/;"	b
Remove 3D projective distortions	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^The properties of 3D transformation can be simply regarded as an extension from 2D transformations (Section \\ref{2d_proj_trans}) to 3D. Please refer to Section 3.4 in Ref. \\cite{hartley2003multiple} for details.$/;"	u
Remove entire projective distortion	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\end{enumerate}$/;"	b
Skew-symmetric matrix and rotation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Quaternions also avoid a phenomenon called \\textit{gimbal lock} which can result when, for example in pitch\/yaw\/roll rotational systems, the pitch is rotated $90^{\\circ}$ up or down, so that yaw and roll then correspond to the same motion, and a degree of freedom of rotation is lost. In a gimbal-based aerospace inertial navigation system, for instance, this could have disastrous results if the aircraft is in a steep dive or ascent. A very good video of gimbal lock problem is shown in Ref. \\cite{gimbalock}.$/;"	u
Specific form of skew-symmetric rotation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^From Theorem \\ref{thm:skew:rot}, any $3 \\times 3$ rotation matrix can be presented by a 3-vector $\\mathbf{t}$. This is another form to parameter the rotation matrix compared to the Euler angle form.$/;"	b
Symmetric matrix	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^where $\\mathbf{R}$ is any rotation matrix with valid dimensions. These are also very intuitive and easily to be checked using the property of orthogonal matrix in Eq. (\\ref{eq:orthogonal:2}).$/;"	u
The hierarchy of 3D Projective transformation	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^\\end{enumerate}$/;"	u
Transformed conic	3d-geometry/main.tex	/^Note that dual conics are also known as \\textbf{conic envelopes}. In geometry, an \\textbf{envelope} of a family of curves in the plane is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point, and these points of tangency together form the whole envelope. Therefore, lines satisfying $\\mathbf{l^\\top C^* l} = 0$ are tangent to point conic $\\mathbf{C}$. That is, a point conic $\\mathbf{C}$ is the envelope of line family $\\mathbf{l}$ (see Figure 2.2 on Page 32 of Ref. \\cite{hartley2003multiple}). $/;"	b
